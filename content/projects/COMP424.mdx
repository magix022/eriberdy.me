This project was the final project for the COMP 424 course at McGill University, and consisted of creating a game AI that would compete in a tournament against other students' agents.
The game consists of putting 2 agents in a grid, where the agents can move around and place walls, and where the goal is to end up with biggest is to be in control of the highest number of cells after the 2 agents are fully separated from each other by walls.

My agent is based on Alpha-Beta pruning, and uses a heuristic that takes into account the number of reachable cell each turn.

Final grade for the tournament, based on performance against other agents: 94.43%

Final grade: A (4.0/4.0)
