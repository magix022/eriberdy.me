Played around with automated video creation using Reddit API and ffmpeg. The idea was to create a tool that would automatically create a video of the top posts of a subreddit, with the title and the content of the post being read out loud by a text-to-speech engine.
This tool takes care of creating the subtitles, tts, and matches those using Gentle force aligner.

Worked nice for a while, but the cost of eleven labs was getting to big so I stopped using it.
