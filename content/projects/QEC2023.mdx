The Quebec Engineering Competition is the second round of the Engineering Competition series, determining the representatives of each province at the Canadian Engineering Competition.
The competition was hosted by Laval University in Quebec City.

The programming competition consisted of a 12 hour period to develop a game bot to play against other teams in a 2D virtual environment, where the environment around agents were not known to them and ressources had to be collected.

Our team developed a bot that was able to compete for objectives against other teams. We were able to secure 2nd place in the competition.
