Smartess is what I've spent most of my time on since the past 2 years.
We are building a smart home platform for residential communities so that smart home technology can truly be accessible to everyone.
The platform is designed to be installed in new residential buildings and will allow for the management of all smart devices in the building, from the lights to the thermostats and the locks, while providing those controls instantly to tenants.
The platform also features various features for owners, like data analysis, communications with tenants, management of the building and more.

We are still in the early stages of development, but we are making great progress and will be ready to reveal more really soon.

As for the company itself, it is still in its infancy stages, and a lot of our time was spent on learning the ropes of doing business.
We are happy to share that we were selected to be member of the [Centech Montreal](https://centech.co/en/) Fall 2024 cohort, which is set to being on the first week of September.

If you are interested by the project, feel free to visit our website and subscribe to our newsletter to be the first to know when we launch, or you can also contact me directly.

As for my technical contribution to this project, which started 2 years ago, I was solely responsible for the development of our backend, which was done in NodeJS using technologies like express and sequelize.
I've also contributed greatly to the development of the user mobile app, which is now close to release on the app stores.
The app was developed using React Native and Expo.
You can check out the [User App demo video](https://youtu.be/1NgdYvEypaU) to get a feel of what was done.

There is so much more I could say, but I'll leave it at that for now. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly.
