The Quebec Engineering Games is the biggest engineering competition in Canada, gathering over 500 students from universities across the province.
The competition was hosted by the University of Sherbrooke.

The Software Engineering category of the competition consisted of a theoretical exam and a practical set of problems. I was part of the practical team, where we had to solve multiple programming problems related to all fields of software engineering.
I personaly solved problems related to pathfinding and web development. 

Our team was able to secure 1st place in the competition.
