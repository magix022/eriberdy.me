The McGill Engineering Competition is the first round of competition in the Engineering Competition series.
It is a local competition that brings together the top engineering students from McGill University to compete in eight different competitions. 
The competition is held annually in November and is hosted by the Engineering Undergraduate Society of McGill University, and is used to determine the teams that will represent McGill University at the Quebec Engineering Competition.

This year's programming category competition lasted for 12 straight hours, and consisted of 5 different problems related to computer science to be solved, and a final presentation in front of judges to explain our solutions.
